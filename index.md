## M106 Math of Decision and Beauty Summer 2020 Lecture Notes

During the summer of 2020, I was an assistant instructor for the Indiana University class Math of Decision and Beauty (M106). This class is a survey of various areas of math involved in "art" as well as in "decision". In this class, we learn symmetries (i.e., group theory involving symmetry groups), game theory, graph theory, voting theory, perspectives (i.e., linear algebra in 3 dimensions) all at an introductory level.

Here are my lecture notes for my M106 recitation lectures during this class:

-[Symmetries (6/9-6/12 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/symmetries.pdf)

-[Game Theory (6/13-6/24 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/game-theory.pdf)

-[Graph Theory (6/26-7/7 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/graph-theory.pdf)

-[Voting Theory (7/9-7/17 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/voting-theory.pdf)

-[Perspectives (7/21-7/28 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/perspective.pdf)
