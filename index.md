## M106 Math of Decision and Beauty Summer 2020 Lecture Notes

During the summer of 2020, I was an assistant instructor for the Indiana University class Math of Decision and Beauty (M106). This class is a survey of various areas of math involved in "art" as well as in "decision". In this class, we teach symmetries (i.e., group theory involving symmetry groups), game theory, graph theory, voting theory, perspectives (i.e., linear algebra in 3 dimensions) at an introductory level.

Here are my lecture notes for my M106 recitation lectures during this class.

-[Symmetries (6/9-6/12 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/symmetries.pdf)

-[Game Theory (6/13-6/24 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/game-theory.pdf)

-[Graph Theory (6/26-7/7 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/graph-theory.pdf)

-[Voting Theory (7/9-7/17 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/voting-theory.pdf)

-[Perspectives (7/21-7/28 lectures)](https://agoodlad-instructor-notes.github.io/m106-summer-2020/perspective.pdf)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/agoodlad-instructor-notes/m106-summer-2020/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/agoodlad-instructor-notes/m106-summer-2020/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
